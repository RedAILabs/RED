## Red – Self-taught. Secure. Superintelligent.
An independent AI initiative from India.

Red is a research-driven project aimed at building a self-taught, secure, and sovereign AI system — designed and trained entirely from scratch using open frameworks like NumPy and PyTorch, before scaling to a T5-based architecture.

# Vision

To create an AI that learns, reasons, and grows autonomously — not by depending on massive pretraining data dumps, but by understanding logic, emotion, and context through self-learning methods.
Red stands for independence in intelligence — a model that evolves without blind imitation of larger systems.

# Mission

Red is an ongoing attempt to:
Build an LLM from first principles, starting with neural nets coded purely in NumPy.
Progress toward a T5-based architecture, optimized for efficient reasoning, multilingual understanding, and knowledge grounding.
Focus on trust, security, and data sovereignty — ensuring AI remains locally deployable and privacy-preserving.
Encourage open education in AI — showing that even a student can build from scratch with determination, curiosity, and research discipline.

# Current Focus

Building and training small-scale language models using NumPy, PyTorch, and Hugging Face Transformers.

Implementing core NLP components: tokenization, attention, sequence-to-sequence modeling, and text generation.

Developing the Red-T5 prototype, a streamlined variant for reasoning and conversational tasks.

# Our Journey

What began as a cybersecurity student’s learning experiment — writing simple neural networks with ReLU, Sigmoid, and backpropagation — evolved into a structured research initiative:

Phase 1: Built a NumPy neural network with full backpropagation and gradient tracking.

Phase 2: Implemented dataset parsing, vectorization, and text generation layers.

Phase 3 (Ongoing): Transitioning into a T5-based model, trained on curated, ethical datasets.

Throughout this journey, every script, result, and failure shaped Red into more than a project — it became a symbol of self-taught intelligence.

# Core Values

Self-learning – AI should evolve with minimal human labeling.

Security – Privacy and sovereignty are non-negotiable.

Transparency – Open development fosters true progress.

Resilience – Build models that can recover, adapt, and continue learning.
